# Feed Forward Neural Network in C++ 17 and OpenMP for performance optimization

## Introduction

This is my implementation for the project in my ECE 572 course. In this repository, you will find 3 separate _code_ directories:
* serial
* parallel
* python

The `serial` directory will have a `C++ 17` implementation of the Feed Forward Neural Network running in serial mode. The `parallel` directory will have a `C++ 17` implementation of the Feed Forward Neural Network running in parallel using `OpenMP 5.1`. The `python` directory will have a `Python` implementation of the same Feed Forward Neural Network configured using the `PyTorch` deep learning framework, which is the most used and optimized deep learning framework for Python programmers. Those 3 implementations will be compared to actually realise the optimization magnitude of the parallelized `C ++` implementation for the purposes of this project.
